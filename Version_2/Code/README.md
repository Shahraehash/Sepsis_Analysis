Sepsis is a life-threatening condition that affects million adults in the United States every year. To investigate the disease further, there is a need to estimate the number of patients that may develop Sepsis in a particular year. Therefore, to estimate the number of Sepsis patients in 2023, this report describes a model that was created using patient data of diseases that have been shown to be correlated with Sepsis. The model has an R2 value of 0.956 and a mean squared error of 0.021 and estimated that for 2023, Los Angeles, CA, Chicago IL, Houston, TX, and Philadelphia, PA will be the regions with the greatest number of Sepsis patients. 

To run this code: 

```
